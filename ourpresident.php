Quality goes hand-in-hand with Excellence. An Excellent mode of education is a balanced amalgamation of both the tradition method as well as the recent E-education. This is because of the paradigm shift from local to global; a healthy process which demands from us an urgent need to adapt to the very modern teaching and learning</p> </br>
